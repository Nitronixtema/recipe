* Since performance is important for us, therefore, I choose the most recent version of PHP.
* I read the json file character by character because a file may consist of one line for several gigabytes.
* It was very important to separate logic by files. Otherwise it will be impossible to extend the logic. I did some minimum of it.
* As we discussed you don't need production ready code and to cover with tests everything.
* I had eye surgery and all text is still blurry for me. It was a bit painful to finish the task =\ I will be OK in a few weeks. :)
